# Online Store Discounts

This project analyzes the discounts offered by an online store. The main goal of this project is to examine and analyze discount data and provide statistical and analytical results.

## Files and Folders
- `Online Store Discounts.ipynb`: The main notebook of the project containing the code and analyses performed.
- `tarikhche_kharid.csv`: The raw data file containing discount information.
- `df.csv`: The processed data file used for further analysis.

## Usage
1. Open the `Online Store Discounts.ipynb` notebook.
2. Install and import the required libraries.
3. Load the data from the `tarikhche_kharid.csv` file.
